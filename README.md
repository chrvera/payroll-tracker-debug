# payroll-tracker-debug

##Description

The purpose of this project, was to take an existing project and improve upon the functionality to allow a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This was done by adding to the existing Javascript code.

-The application asl the user for the employee's first name, last name and salary
-The application then gives the option for the user to loop back and another employee or be finished with their imputs
-Once finished, all the inputed employee data is displayed on the page
-The console allows the user to see the average salary of all employee's as well as pull a random employee from all the employees who's data has been submitted

-The modified application makes it easier for the user to follow the prompts for imputting data, seeing the aggregate data in the end and the average of the data that was input.
